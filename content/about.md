Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring software developer from India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³  I recently graduated from IIIT Bh with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering and I am **open to entry-level programming roles** right now.

I code mostly using Go. I have developed individual projects that implement REST APIs, gRPC protocols. To view these projects and my other Open Source contributions to various repositories, feel free to visit [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/penthaapatel). 

Follow along my programming journey here on [my blog](/posts) where I document my learnings. The posts I publish here are accompanied by code snippets and complete source code for easier understanding.

Apart from programming, I love to paint,draw ðŸŽ¨ and play chess â™Ÿ.
