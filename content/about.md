Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an aspiring software developer from India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ and I recently graduated from IIIT Bh with a Bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering.

I code mostly using Go. My interests include playing around with Go code that implement modern day Microservices using RPC protocol. I also have a fair knowledge on implementation of REST APIs. I have developed individual projects on these topics which can be found on [my GitHub profile](https://github.com/penthaapatel). 

Follow along my programming journey here on [my blog](/posts) where I document my learnings. The posts I publish here are accompanied by code snippets and complete source code for easier understanding.

Apart from programming, I love to paint,draw ðŸŽ¨ and play chess â™Ÿ.
